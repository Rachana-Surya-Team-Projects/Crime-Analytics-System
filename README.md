# 🚓 Crime Analytics System
### A Scalable Data Analytics Platform for Law Enforcement Intelligence

---

## 📌 Overview
The **Crime Analytics System** is an end-to-end data analytics platform designed to help law enforcement agencies **store, analyze, and visualize large-scale crime data**.

The system integrates a **fully normalized PostgreSQL relational database**, **advanced SQL logic** (stored procedures, triggers, indexing), and an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to support **data-driven policing decisions**.

This project demonstrates **database engineering, performance optimization, transactional integrity, and analytics visualization** on a realistic, high-volume dataset.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Design a secure, normalized relational database for crime-related records  
- Enable fast analytical queries over large datasets  
- Ensure transactional safety and data integrity  
- Provide visual insights for crime trends, officer workload, and hotspot analysis  
- Deliver a production-ready analytics workflow suitable for real-world use  

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
**Data Flow:**  
`Synthetic Data → PostgreSQL → SQL Analytics → Tableau Dashboard`

### Core Components
- Relational Database (PostgreSQL)
- ETL & Data Validation Scripts
- Stored Procedures & Triggers
- Indexed Analytical Queries
- Tableau Dashboard (Visualization Layer)

---

## 🗄️ Database Design
- **100% normalized schema (3NF)**
- **11 interrelated tables**, including:
  - CrimeReports
  - Cases
  - Suspects
  - Arrests
  - Officers
  - Locations
  - Victims
  - Witnesses
  - Evidence
  - CourtCases
  - OfficerBadge

### Key Features
- Primary & Foreign Key enforcement
- CHECK constraints for data validation
- Cascading delete/update rules
- One-to-one and one-to-many relationships

📌 **Schema:** `SQL Create Table.sql`  
📌 **ER Diagram:** `Entity Relationship Diagram.png`

---

## ⚙️ Data Engineering & ETL
- Inserted **50,000+ synthetic records** across all entities
- Maintained referential integrity across tables
- Eliminated redundancy through normalization
- Ensured scalable inserts for analytical workloads

📌 **Data Load Script:** `SQL Insert Table.sql`

---

## 🧠 Advanced SQL & Backend Logic

### Stored Procedures & Functions
- Insert, update, and delete operations with validation
- Parameterized analytical functions (e.g., crimes by city)
- Error handling using `FOUND` and exception blocks

### Triggers & Transaction Handling
- Automatic logging of failed transactions
- Enforced business rules (e.g., unique badge assignment)
- Demonstrated rollback and atomicity guarantees

📌 **Files:**
- `SQL Queries Implementation.sql`
- `Transaction Handling Using Triggers.sql`

---

## 🚀 Performance Optimization
- Designed targeted indexes on high-frequency query columns
- Benchmarked performance using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
- Achieved:
  - **~60% reduction in data duplication**
  - **~40% improvement in query execution time**

📌 **Indexing Script:** `SQL Indexing.sql`

---

## 📊 Analytics & Visualization (Tableau)
Developed an **interactive Tableau dashboard** enabling:
- Crime distribution by type and city
- Time-based crime trend analysis
- Officer workload insights
- Case status monitoring
- Visual support for hotspot identification

📌 **Dashboard:** `Crime Analytics System Dashboard Tableau.twbx`
